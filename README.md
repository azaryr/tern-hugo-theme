# tern-hugo-theme
Tern - is a simple, clean, responsive theme for Hugo static site generator. I created this theme to be used on my personal blog built with Hugo.  

"White Tern" is a name of a bird common in the island I grew up in Maldives. White tern has a all-white plumage. The tail is long with a shallow fork. The eyes, eye-rings and bill are black and the legs and feet greyish. The theme is based on white and grey.
